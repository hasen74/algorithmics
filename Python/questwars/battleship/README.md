## Battleship field validator

**My solution for the kyu3-level kata from codewars.com**

https://www.codewars.com/kata/52bb6539a4cf1b12d90005b7

Features 2D arrays.

It is to be noted that the proximity checks have to be adapted depending if the checked cell's position is at the left side, right side, or middle of the board. See Kyu3-2.jpg for details.
